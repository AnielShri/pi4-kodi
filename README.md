I'm using a Raspberry Pi 4 (4GB) as a compact media server. It is connected to a smart TV (Sony Bravia) through the HDMI port. It also has a 1TB HDD connected to one of the USB 3 ports for file storage. 

This repository is essentially where I will store configuration files and notes to recreate the media server.

Check out the sub-folders for more information.
